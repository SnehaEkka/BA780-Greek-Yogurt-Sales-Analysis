## Motivation
The dairy industry is a vital component of global food systems, with its performance having far-reaching impacts on various stakeholders. Understanding the complex interplay of external factors affecting this sector is essential for multiple reasons.

## Business Problem
To address the need for in-depth industry insights, this project analyzes the sales performance of Mevgal, a leading Greek dairy company. Our analysis aims to tackle three key areas:
- ***Dairy Market Dynamics:*** Identify trends and fluctuations in dairy product sales to understand consumption patterns and seasonal variations.

- ***Impact of External Factors:*** Assess how economic, environmental, and technological factors influence the dairy market, providing insights into how broader trends affect industry performance and consumer behavior.
Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to provide actionable insights that can support decision-making and strategy development in the dynamic dairy industry, benefiting not only Mevgal but also related sectors and consumers.

## Analysis Summary
